					<h1>Slavery and Inefficiency</h1>
					<p>by Zachary Groz</p>
					<p>History 2/18/18</p>
					<hr/>
					<a href="Article1.html"><img class="content4" src="img/Cellular_Automata17 copy.jpg" width=75% height=75%></a>
					<hr/>
					<p class="content6">It is a remarkably difficult task to concisely convey the overwhelming brutality of American slavery. Adjectives such as “evil,” “depraved,” “immoral,” “oppressive,” and “despicable” only begin to describe its horrors. But one adjective, in particular, provides a distinctly insufficient, even regressive, depiction of American slavery: inefficient.
					</p> 
					<br>
					<p class="content6">The predominant strand of historical thought concerning American slavery that has persisted from Antebellum times to the present has characterized its institution as an inefficient and wasteful mode of labor, detrimental to regional and national productivity. This is a benighted approach to understanding and contextualizing the atrocities of the American slave system. The relative efficiency of the Southern slave empire of Antebellum America is irrelevant to the discussion of the immorality of slavery. The perversions of slavery did not derive from scarcity of profit or inefficient production but from its inherent tyranny. Once the language used to describe slavery becomes solely utilitarian, its inhumanity is lost.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="content6">Framing slavery as a backward method of labor simply because of its supposed inefficiency, likewise, assumes the perspective of the master. The commercial profit amassed as a result of slave production remained the sole possession of the plantation-owning class and its Northern mercantile allies. Efficiency, therefore, was the master’s principal concern. Increases in the efficiency of slave production would strengthen his political authority and expand his material wealth. Inefficiency would render his economic circumstances unchanged or diminished. Designating slavery as an inefficient institution, therefore, emphasizes the condition of the master and not the slave.</p> 
					<br>
					<p class="content6">But aside from the counterproductive nature of the inefficiency critique, the claim itself—that slavery was an inefficient mode of labor—is suspect. Contemporary critics of the Southern slave paradigm frequently contrasted the efficiency of Northern free labor farms with that of plantation systems in the South in order to formulate a coherent and compelling antislavery economic argument. To Northern free labor proponents, the institution of Southern slavery, while emblematic of a larger political predicament, remained the source of the degradation of labor that propelled financial insecurity. Antislavery advocates asserted that the Southern slave order remained compounded by inefficient design and practice. Yet statistical analysis of Antebellum slavery yields disparate results. The plantation system, on an annual basis, produced nearly 40 percent more output than Northern free labor farms. Southern plantations, similarly, exceeded their Northern free labor competitors by nearly 50 percent in terms of efficiency. Greater labor capacity, technological and geographical advantage, and divergence in economic structure contributed immensely to the disparity between the efficiency of Southern and Northern agriculture in the Antebellum period. The North remained the central manufacturing economy of the nation, while the South functioned as a plantation society, focused on international imperial expansion and raw material production. Local improvement in farming technique was, in turn, a requisite for greater material gain in the South in the same way that mechanical innovation was in the North.</p> 
					<br>
					<p class="content6">Improvements in agricultural efficiency in the South produced far harsher requirements for slave labor than before. The invention of the mechanical reaper heightened expectations for production, rendering retaliation for work that was deemed “inefficient” ever more brutal. The advent of the cotton gin had a similar, only more widespread, effect on master-slave relations.</p>   
					<br>
					<p class="content6">The improved efficiency of slavery and Southern commodity production, besides worsening the quality of already abhorrent working conditions, helped to induce national political calamity. The allure of profit impelled capital-minded Southern plantation oligarchs to begin Westward expansion and the reallocation of labor to newly acquired territory. Congress, then the political arm of the South, initiated the annexation of Western lands and, in turn, precipitated pre-war physical confrontation in the Bleeding Kansas skirmish. The morbid efficiency of slavery had directly hastened civil conflict.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="content6">It is therefore imperative that future interpretations of the oppressive history of American slavery address the considerable evidence suggesting a correlation between efficiency and slave production so as to provide a more accurate depiction of that despotic institution and contextualize its barbarous existence. The inefficient characterization distracts from the conspicuous abuses of slavery and consequently must be abandoned in historical analysis.</p>
