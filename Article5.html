					<p>Translation 1/21/18</p>
					<hr/>
					<a href="Article5.html"><img class="content4" src="img/Cellular_Automata6 copy.jpg" width=75% height=75%></a>
					<hr/>
					<p class="content6">Sing, goddess, of the destructive wrath of 	Peleus’s son Achilles,
					which cast immeasurable pain upon the Achaeans,
					which hurled many strong souls of heroes down to Hades,
					and which made those men the prey of water birds, dogs, and ravens
					—and so the plan of Zeus was enacted.
					From that time, the son of Atreus, ruler of men, and godly Achilles parted, discordant.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="content6">Which of the gods brought these two together in conflict?
					It was the son of Leto and Zeus. For, angered by the king, he furnished
					a baneful plague amongst his ranks, and his men continued to perish,
					because the son of Atreus had dishonored that priest Chryses.
					For he ventured swiftly to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, bearing limitless ransom
					and carrying the garlands of Apollo the far-striker in his hands upon a golden scepter,
					and he begged before the Achaeans, especially the sons of Atreus, the greatest commanders of men:</p>
					<br>
					<p class="content6">“Sons of Atreus and other well-greaved Achaeans,
					may the gods who dwell in Olympian houses enable you
					to level Priam’s city and return home safely;
					standing in awe of far-shooting Apollo, son of Zeus, release my beloved child and accept this ransom.”
					<br>
					<p class="content6">Then all of the other Achaeans cried out in approval
					to respect the holy one and accept the splendid ransom;
					yet it did not please the soul of Agamemnon, son of Atreus,
					but he wickedly dismissed him and commanded him with violent speech:</p>
					<br>
					<p class="content6">“Let me never meet with you again beside this hollow ship, old man,
					either by delaying now or returning sometime in the future.
					Your scepter and garland will do nothing for you.
					I will not release her until she grows old in my house in Argos, far off from her native land,
					tending to her loom and tending to me in bed.
					But get lost and don’t provoke a fight. You’ll make a safer return.”</p>

					<p class="content6">Thus he spoke, and the old man shrunk with fear and obeyed his word;
					he went unwillingly to the shore of the resounding sea.
					The old man, once far away, prayed many prayers to the god Apollo, whom beautiful-haired Leto bore:</p> 

					<p class="content6">“Hear me, Smintheus, bearer of the silver bow, who has protected Chryses and
					the sacred Killa and who ruled Tenedos with force.
					If I have covered a roof upon a temple that pleased you,
					or if I have burned the fat along the thigh bones of bulls and goats for you,
					then fulfill my wish;
					may the Danaans pay a price for my tears with your arrows.”</p>

					<p class="content6">Thus he spoke in prayer; and Phoebis Apollo heard him.
					And he descended the peaks of Olympus, his soul enraged,
					carrying his bow slung over his shoulder and his close-covered quiver;
					The arrows emitted a scream upon the shoulders of the raging one
					as he glided along; he moved like the night.
					Then he set himself apart from the ships and sent forth an arrow;
					terrible was the clatter of his silver bow.
					First he slaughtered their mules and their silver dogs,
					but then, launching pointed missiles, he struck the men themselves.
					The crowded pyres of corpses blazed with no end.</p>

					<p class="content6">For nine days the arrows of the god took flight upon the army,
					but on the tenth, Achilles summoned them to the assembly;
					For the white-armed goddess Hera inspired him thus. For she was concerned about the Danaans, as she had viewed their slaughter.
					So once gathered together,
					swift-footed Achilles spoke, standing before them:</p>

					<p class="content6">“Son of Atreus, now I think that we, beaten back once more, should return home,
					if we might escape from ruin,
					for war and plague together are overwhelming the Achaeans.
					But let us invite some prophet or priest
					or even an interpreter of dreams—for a dream comes from Zeus—,
					who might say why Phoebis Apollo has been angered immensely,
					if he casts the blame upon a prayer or an offering of one hundred oxen;
					I suppose, then, that after partaking of the fat of perfect goats and perfect lambs
					he would be willing to shield us from destruction.”</p>

					<p class="content6">After speaking well, he sat down. And rising before them was
					Calchas, son of Thestor, the bravest of the soothsayers, 
					who knows the things that exist now, the things that will exist, and the things that existed before,
					and who led the Achaeans in ships to Troy
					according to his divine art, which Phoebis Apollo offered to him;
					He stood in the assembly and taking great care, addressed them well:</p>

					<p class="content6">“Oh Achilles, dear to Zeus, you exhort me to interpret
					the wrath of far-shooting master Apollo.
					Therefore, I will speak for myself; take an oath and swear to me
					truly, of your own volition, that you will help me with your words and hands.
					Truthfully, I believe that I may anger a man who is far more powerful than all of the Argives and to whom the Achaeans defer.
					For a king becomes stronger when provoked by a weaker man.
					For if just on that same day he were to digest his wrath,
					he would still bear a burden in his breast, until he relieves it.
					So you should consider whether you will save me.”
					Replying, swift-footed Achilles addressed him:</p>

					<p class="content6">“Being of great courage, surely tell the prophecy, whichever one you may know;
					For by Apollo who is dear to Zeus, whom you, Calchas, supplicate when interpreting oracles for 		the Danaans,
					no one of the Danaans, while I, at least, am still alive and have sight upon the earth,
					will bring their heavy hands upon you beside these hollow ships,
					not even if you address Agamemnon, who now professes to be by far the bravest of all the Achaeans.”</p>

					<p class="content6">And then he took courage and the blameless seer spoke,
					“He does not blame us for a prayer or a hecatomb,
					but because of the priest, whom Agamemnon dishonored,
					and did not release his daughter nor accept his ransom.
					It is for this reason that, with his aim locked, he has delivered pain and will continue to deliver it.
					He will not divert disastrous ruin for the Danaans
					until the lively-eyed daughter is returned to her beloved father
					without a price and without any payment, and sacrifices and a hecatomb are brought to Chryses. 
					Then, once thoroughly appeased, we might persuade him.”</p>

					<p class="content6">After speaking well he sat down. The following man stood up,
					the hero, son of Atreus, broad-bodied Agamemnon, enraged.
					Filling his great blackened soul with might, his eyes looked as great as a flame glimmering.
					Threateningly, he first spoke to Calchas,</p>

					<p class="content6">“Wicked seer, you’ve never complimented me, not even once.
					You’re always delivering evil prophesies that are dear to your heart. 
					You’ve said nothing good and have accomplished nothing good;
					and now you speak here before this assembly, delivering prophesies to the Danaans
					about why the far-shooter wrought such pain for us;
					because I refused to accept the splendid ransom for the daughter of Chryses, since I heartily prefer to keep her at home. 
					For I also prefer her to my wedded wife Clytemnestra, since she is not inferior to her,
					not in body, nor in form, not in heart, nor in work,
					but I also am willing to give her back, if it would make things better;
					I like my men better safe than murdered.
					Nevertheless, get a gift ready for me at once, so that I’m not the only one of the Argives without 		one, which would not be suitable in the slightest.
					For all of you look at this: my gifts now go to someone else.” 
					Then heavenly Achilles with swift feet responded thusly,
					“Noblest son of Atreus, envious of all,
					how will the great-hearted Achaeans laden you with gifts?
					Still not even we know about an abundance of prizes that have been stashed away.
					But these things that we ravaged from the cities are distributed amongst ourselves,
					and it does not suit the men to gather things that have already been collected.
					But now send forth this one to the god; nevertheless, we the Achaeans will repay threefold and 		fourfold, if Zeus, in any case, were to allow us to sack the well-fortified city of Troy.”</p>

					<p class="content6">Replying, the lord Agamemnon spoke forth to him,
					“Do not, just in this way, though you’re well-born, godlike Achilles,
					try to cheat me, since you won’t get past me and you’ll persuade me of nothing.
					Or maybe you, so that you get your own prize, want me, at least, to sit here longingly, as you still 	command me to give her back.
					But if the great-hearted Achaeans should give up some prize, in a way pleasing to my heart, see		to it that it is a worthy one—  
					And if they do not do so, I will take it myself;
					I’ll either take your prize or Ajax’s or Odysseus’s for myself, snatching it away.
					And he will be furious, whoever I come to.
					But we will reconsider these matters later in the future.
					Now let’s draw up our black ship into the heavenly sea,
					and there we will hastily gather the rowers together,
					and place a hecatomb; and we will take away that beautiful-cheeked daughter of Chryses.
					Let some counsel-bearing man be commander,
					either Ajax, Idomeneus, or heavenly Odysseus.
					Or you, son of Peleus, the most terrible of all men,
					so that you might appease the far-worker Apollo for us by performing the sacrifices.”</p>

					<p class="content6">Glaring, swift-footed Achilles spoke,
					“Ugh, you are clothed in shamelessness, you greedy bastard,
					how will any of the Achaeans obey your words,
					either to go on a journey or to battle other men with force?
					For I did not come here to fight on account of any Trojan spearmen, since they are not 			responsible.
					For they did not drive away my bulls nor my horses,
					nor did they even once, in fertile Phthia, the place that’s a nurse of heroes,
					hurt my profit, even while in the midst of very many shadowy mountains and the roaring sea.
					But you, oh exceedingly shameless one, we followed, so that you might be satisfied,
					earning honor for yourself and Menelaus from the Trojans, hound-face. 
					You don’t recall these things and you don’t even care a bit.
					And still you threaten to snatch these prizes, which the Achaeans gave to me,
					for which I have suffered many things.
					I don’t have prizes equal to yours, even after the Achaeans decimate Troy, the well-inhabited citadel.
					But my hands are conducting the greater part of this furious war,
					even though once a distribution of the spoils comes,
					many of the prizes will be for you, and I, having little but beloved things, will return to the ships, 	since I have suffered from waging war.
					Now I’m off to Phthia, for it is far better to head back home on curved ships,
					and I do not think I, dishonored, will heap up wealth and riches here for you.”</p>

					<p class="content6">Then Agamemnon, ruler of men, responded,
					“Get the hell out of here, if your mind is agitated. I’m not begging for you to stay here on my account.
					Besides myself, there are others who revere me, and all-knowing Zeus too.
					To me, you are the most despised of the kings, nourished by Zeus.
					For battle, wars, and strife are all always dear to you.
					And if you actually have any strength, a god gave it to you.
					After going back home with your ships and your comrades,
					you’ll lord over the Myrmidons. I don’t care a thing about you,
					nor do I care about any grudge you bear. And I promise this to you:
					as Phoebis Apollo stole the daughter of Chryses from me,
					I will send her away with my ship and my men,
					and I will go into your tent and snatch your prize, beautiful-cheeked Briseis, for myself,
					so that you know well how much greater I am than you, and the others will fear
					to claim that they are equal to me and compare themselves against me.”</p>

					<p class="content6">Thus he spoke, and anguish fell upon the son of Peleus, and his heart
					grew anxious in his hairy breast in two ways, thinking to
					either draw his bright sword from the side of his thigh,
					disbanding the assembly, and slaughter the son of Atreus,
					or to quell his fury and check his heart.
					While he debated this in his mind and in his heart,
					he dragged his great sword out from its sheath, and Athena descended from heaven.
					For the white-armed goddess Hera had sent her forth,
					equally attracted to both men and disturbed at heart.
					She stood behind and grabbed the golden hair of the son of Peleus,
					appearing only to him; none of the others could see her.
					Achilles was wonderstruck, and he turned around. 
					Immediately he knew that it was Pallas Athena—her eyes shined terribly—
					Addressing her, he spoke winged words,
					“Why have you come, child of aegis-bearing Zeus?
					Is it so that you might see the hubris of Agamemnon, son of Atreus?
					But I’ll speak forth to you and I think this will be fulfilled:
					by his own insolence he will quickly induce his destruction.</p> 

					<p class="content6">Again the goddess Athena spoke forth to him with her eyes shining:
					“I came from heaven to put an end to your passion, if you choose to obey me.
					The white-armed goddess Hera came to me,
					still loving both of you and feeling distressed at heart.
					But come now, put aside your rivalry, and don’t lift your sword with your hand.
					Use your words instead, and tell him how it will be.
					For so I will speak and this will, indeed, be accomplished.
					And at some point there will be three times as many splendid gifts for you 
					because of his hubris.
					Be restrained and yield to us.”
					Replying to her, swift-footed Achilles spoke forth:
					“I ought to obey the words of both of you, even though I have been greatly 
					angered at heart, for it is better to do so.
					He who is persuaded by the gods will receive their eager attention.”</p>

					<p class="content6">He spoke, his heavy hand still grasped the silver handle and he thrust the great sword
					back into its sheath. 
					He did not disobey the word of Athena. 
					And she returned to Olympus and the house of aegis-bearing Zeus
					to rejoin the other goddesses.</p>

					<p class="content6">Once again the son of Peleus addressed the son of Atreus with abusive words
					and maintained his ire:
					“You drunkard. You have the eyes of a dog and the heart of a deer.
					You don’t dare arm yourself with the common folk in battle and
					you don’t suffer to go with the most valorous of the Achaeans to an ambush.
					For this seems to you to be like death.
					Indeed it is far more desirable to snatch the prizes throughout the far-reaching
					camps of the Achaeans from he who speaks against you.
					You, the king who devours the common man, while you lord over worthless things.
					For surely, son of Atreus, you have abused me for the last time.
					But I will address you and swear by a great oath.
					Fervently by this scepter, which will never spring forth leaves and branches,
					since it first left its stump atop the mountains,
					it will never sprout anew; for the copper has stripped both of its sides,
					its leaves and bark.
					Now the sons of the Achaeans grasp it in their palms, adjudicating and bringing
					forth the decisions of Zeus. 
					And you will have a mighty oath.
					Indeed, someday the desire for Achilles will boil inside all of the sons of the Achaeans.
					Then you won’t be able to defend them, even in mourning.
					When many fall to Hector, butcher of men, slaughtered,
					you will tear at your embedded heart in fury
					that you payed no tribute to the best of the Achaeans.”</p>
